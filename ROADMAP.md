# Helios FHIR Server — Roadmap

>
> This document outlines the development direction for the Helios FHIR Server. It is organized into three horizons — **Now**, **Next**, and **Later** — to set expectations without overpromising timelines. Items may shift between horizons as priorities evolve based on community feedback, production needs, and contributor availability.

## 🔨 Now — Actively In Progress

Work that is currently underway or planned for the near term.

| Area | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| **Compliance** | Audit logging (AuditEvent resource support) | 🔵 Design |
| **Standards** | FHIR Validation engine | 🔵 Design |
| **Standards** | [Authentication & Authorization](https://github.com/HeliosSoftware/hfs/discussions/45) | 🔵 Design |
| **Documentation** | Project documentation website | 🔵 Design |
| **Persistence** | MongoDB as a primary store | 🟡 In progress |

### Discussion Documents

We are actively developing community discussion documents on the following topics to gather feedback before implementation begins. These will be published as GitHub Discussions:

- **[Authentication & Authorization](https://github.com/HeliosSoftware/hfs/discussions/45)** — Scoping the approach to identity, access control, and SMART on FHIR integration
- **Terminology** — Defining how code systems, value sets, and concept maps will be managed
- **Validation** — Establishing the strategy for StructureDefinition-based validation and profiles
- **Audit** — Designing the audit trail architecture and AuditEvent generation

## 🗺️ Next — Up After Current Work

These items are well-understood and will be picked up once current work completes.

### FHIR Server Capabilities
- **Bulk Data API** — Import and export (`$export` / `$import` operations)
- **FHIR Subscriptions** — Topic-based notification support
- **Terminology Server** — CodeSystem `$lookup`, ValueSet `$expand`, ConceptMap `$translate`
- **SMART on FHIR** — Full launch framework and scoped access
- **SQL on FHIR** — [SQL on FHIR operations](https://sql-on-fhir.org/ig/latest/operations.html) - using read-only database connections 

### Persistence Backends
- Cassandra as a primary store
- ClickHouse as a primary store
- Cassandra with Elasticsearch as a query secondary

### Developer Experience
- **Administrative UI** — Web-based management console for server configuration and monitoring
- **MCP Server for FHIR API** — Model Context Protocol integration for the FHIR REST API
- **MCP Server for SQL on FHIR** — Model Context Protocol integration for analytics workflows
- **Deployment Cookbooks** — Reference architectures and deployment templates covering standalone development servers, single-node production setups, composite storage configurations, and full CQRS architectures on AWS, Azure, and GCP

---

## 🔭 Later — On the Horizon

Longer-term ideas we are exploring. These are not yet committed and may evolve significantly based on community input.

### Advanced Persistence
- Neo4j as a primary store
- PostgreSQL with Neo4j as a graph query secondary

### Persistence Advisor
An intelligent recommendation engine for storage configuration:
- Analyze a FHIR query and recommend an optimal persistence configuration
- Leverage historical benchmark data to inform recommendations
- Web UI for interactive configuration guidance
