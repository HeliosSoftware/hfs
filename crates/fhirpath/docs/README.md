# Documentation Directory

This directory contains local copies of specifications and documentation for reference.

## Recommended Documents to Add

### FHIRPath Specification

Download the FHIRPath specification from [HL7 FHIRPath](https://hl7.org/fhirpath/2025Jan/) and save it locally:

```bash
# Download the FHIRPath specification to this directory
wget https://hl7.org/fhirpath/2025Jan/index.html -O fhirpath-spec.html

# Alternatively, save the rendered HTML from your browser for better offline viewing
```

Having the specification locally allows Claude Code to reference it without needing to access the internet during each session.

### FHIR Resources

Consider adding other documentation:

- R4 Resource definitions
- Common extension definitions
