- Re-work crate names such that they can be unique for crates.io

- Make repo public
  - Cleanup main README.md
  - Remove? hfs crate
  - Update hero image

- Add Github Actions for build and release process

- Re-work fhirpath to add a fhirpath server for eventual use with FHIR Path Lab

- Setup hosting for fhirpath server
- Setup hosting for sof-server

- Need to fully test each of the parameters
  - Support viewReference
  - Need to support application/parquet 
  - Support the source parameter

- My CapabilityStatement for $run needs help - name, and unsure about operation vs. resource

- Need a full UCUM conversion engine - Document where we are - should we provide a http call to ucum's service until we have a Rust implementation, or should we use https://github.com/FHIR/Ucum-java? 

- Test to see if invalid attributes in the FHIR JSON model are allowed/disallowed?

- Investigate the tests in https://github.com/FHIR/fhir-test-cases - are the fhirpath tests different for each FHIR version?

- Write README.md for the root - homepage!
- Modify fhir_gen to add Rust docs to r4.rs, others.

- Is there a documented fhirpath validator endpoint, and an apply?

- The cycle detection is over Box'ing types.  It only needs to be done on one, but not the other. e.g. Reference and Identifier - future item - Likely need a priority element to 
  decide - could be helpful too in the future when we need to use it for Cassandra table separation

- Temporarily using strings for Date, DateTime, etc.  After we can prove parsing works, we will go back and code these as proper types.

- Review all READMEs and decide on the outline of yours

    -Product Name: Helios FHIR Server
    -Product tag line:  Build modern healthcare analytics applications.
    -One sentence product description: The Helios FHIR Server is an implementation of the [HL7® FHIR®](https://hl7.org/fhir) standard, built in Rust for high performance and targeted towards clinical analytics workloads.   
    -Why use Helios FHIR Server?
    -What do people build using the Helios FHIR Server?
    -Quick Start
    -Documentation (if not above)

- Manually added ViewDefinition Structure Definition to profiles-resources.json (deleting integer64) for generating r4.rs.  Need to also add it to the others except for r6 (anticipating a ViewDefinition resource to be added to r6) (and adding back in integer64)

- Added fhirVersion to constant_types.json
