Try serde'ing the examples
The cycle detection is over Box'ing types.  It only needs to be done on one, but not the other. e.g. Reference and Identifier - future item - Likely need a priority element to decide - could be helpful too in the future when we need to use it for Cassandra table separation
Temporarily using strings for Date, DateTime, etc.  After we can prove parsing works, we will go back and code these as proper types.
Write readme for fhir_gen
Needs to say it's ok to delete the crates/fhir folder, then run cargo new fhir --lib
Need to add lib.rs to fhir/src/lib.rs.  
There is probably a problem with resources/build it should just be r6
