- For FHIRPath, seems like it is chumsky vs LALROP with logos?  Still unsure how to convert a FHIRPath expression to the resulting nodes.  Should this be done entirely in json?  There 
  are many uses of FHIRPath in the FHIR Spec.  Should we be building a generic tool?  Should chumsky be used for a nice validator only and LALRPOP and logos be used for speed purpposes?
- Is there a fhir path validator endpoint, and an apply?
- The cycle detection is over Box'ing types.  It only needs to be done on one, but not the other. e.g. Reference and Identifier - future item - Likely need a priority element to 
  decide - could be helpful too in the future when we need to use it for Cassandra table separation
- Temporarily using strings for Date, DateTime, etc.  After we can prove parsing works, we will go back and code these as proper types.
