- There are some Special Cases in r4_tests.rs that we need to eliminate
- Remove eprintln from implementation code
- Mismatch of implementation in separate files vs single evaluator.rs
- RESOURCE_TYPE_HIERARCHY is temporarily hard coded
- Need a full UCUM conversion engine  
- Test to see if invalid attributes in the FHIR JSON model are allowed/disallowed?
- R6 tests need help - Integer64 issues in comparison because we download them each time, so might need an exclusion list for R6
- Search for SLM TODO - need to change the others I think
- Investigate the tests in https://github.com/FHIR/fhir-test-cases - are the fhirpath tests different for each FHIR version?
- Write README.md for the root - homepage!
- Write README.md for fhir_gen
- Write README.md for hfs
- Write README.md for fhir
- Write README.md for fhirpath
- Is there a fhir path validator endpoint, and an apply?
- The cycle detection is over Box'ing types.  It only needs to be done on one, but not the other. e.g. Reference and Identifier - future item - Likely need a priority element to 
  decide - could be helpful too in the future when we need to use it for Cassandra table separation
- Temporarily using strings for Date, DateTime, etc.  After we can prove parsing works, we will go back and code these as proper types.
